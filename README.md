# CSC 542

CSC 542 is Neural Networks at NCSU. I took this offering in Spring 2024 under Edgar Lobaton. This repo contains my development setup and notes.


## Setup

First setup a conda environment:

```sh
conda create -n csc542 python=3.10
```

As always, activate and install dependencies:

```sh
conda activate csc542
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
